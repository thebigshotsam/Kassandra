By curating analyzers, predictors, manager tools Kassandra aims to bridge the mammoth deficit in technology infrastructure present today in the organized/unorganized retail sector. Kassandra aims to make the supply chain as agile as it has ever been, right from the warehouse to the customer's doorstep using a wide array of machine learning and artificial intelligence services to build tools and add-ons on the web-platform. This enables the merchants to smartly manage their stock units, prepare for any demand spikes using demand forecasting feature on the platform avoiding any stock cold storage or wastage and capital loss.

# Implementation

A. A brilliant recommender framework API coordinated in a smoothed out way utilizing local backend worker of Node.js is curated in the application pipeline to propose items with comparable costs having a place with the very class as that of the item, retailer or a shipper is worried about from the wide range of various retailers separated by web based business stages and segment districts of revenue

Services Used: Model trained via Azure Databricks. The related API would be deployed using : Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Machine Learning Service, Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Storage for MySQL.

B. A shrewd business interface supplier administration that makes certain business prompts recognize each other for better versatility and reasonability of their items and benefits. We at Kassandra make this conceivable by suggesting Businesses their focused on and prime B2B leads considering their items Demographics and Geographics and so forth.

Services Used: Model trained via Azure Databricks. The related API would be deployed using : Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Machine Learning Service, Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Storage for MySQL.

C. Each organization should anticipate the future with the goal that better choices might be taken for exact arrangement of interest spikes for items and administrations giving upper hand to an enterprise. Kassandra gives a savvy interface wherein shippers anticipate stock patterns in different segment areas and dependent on requests oversee stock units staying away from stock wastage and capital misfortune at every possible opportunity.

Services Used: We build a smart allocator algorithm using Microsoft AI Platform. The calculation is further Improved utilizing Microsoft Azure and the accompanying highlights are added :

            1. Data Intake
            2. Data Storage
            3. Data Processing
            4. Sophisticated Analysis
D. Kassandra likewise expects to give a bunch of proficient highlights focused towards improving the representatives' work conditions. Kassandra centers around enabling the representatives and gives them a few guides in the spaces related (yet not restricted to) to improving their work happiness, improving their work conditions, a concentrated checking framework, alternatives to plan gatherings, setting expectations and furthermore business.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
